      <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><h2 class="text-center">Chicken</h2><p>Back when I was in my 20s, I had a Little Mermaid backpack. Wore it everywhere. Why? Because I really like the Little Mermaid, it was a good backpack, and it let me know immediately which guys were insecure idiots.
If I was on public transport and I saw a guy smirking at my backpack, I was never bothered. I knew that if the two of us were dropped in the bush with nothing, I’d most likely be the one walking out alive. I didn’t need to prove anything to them, and they’d already proved they weren’t worth my time. My Little Pony is awesome. It’s smart! It teaches a great set of values with humour. It has songs! It shows that it’s okay to ask for help, to be kind, to forgive, to believe in oneself, that one can push through and achieve great stuff. But even if it weren’t all those things - let people enjoy what they enjoy! My kids like Pokémon - I hate it with a passion. But I always make it clear to them that that’s fine. They can like it, I can hate it, and it doesn’t matter. I just ask them to watch it when I’m not around so I don’t have to put up with it. I nearly bought myself a Pinkie Pie soft toy the other day. Partially because I knew my kids would love it, partially because I like Pinkie Pie. But I’m trying t declutter at the moment, so I didn’t. But if they’d had a Fluttershy in stock, I’d have definitely bought that!
Even if I weren’t a rough old bugger who likes and tries to protect venomous spiders and snakes, loves horror movies, Swedish Metal bands, Doctor Who, Batman, and is fond of the Princess Diaries and MLP - so what? So what should you do? You should ask your son to show you three great episodes of MLP. You should non-judgementally watch them with him. And even if you hate the show, keep the negativity to yourself. Ask him what he likes about it? Take an interest.</p></div>
